# Machine Learning Regression Models – Custom Implementation

This project showcases a custom implementation of multiple regression models including:
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Linear Regression**

The notebook demonstrates model training, evaluation using common metrics, and preprocessing techniques like scaling and encoding.

### 🚀 Features
- Multi-model training and comparison
- Performance metrics: MSE, MAE, R²
- Data preprocessing pipeline
